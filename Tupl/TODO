
- Fix undo log corruption with long transactions. Possibly caused by eviction.
- Apparent storage leak when deleting records.
- Use 6-byte pointers in internal nodes.
- Support large values.
- Support key prefix compression.
- Support closing indexes. Requires latch sweep and stubbing of cursors.
- Support truncating indexes. Depends on close and workflow to ensure truncate completes.
- Support non-persistent database mode which never writes to files and doesn't require any.
- Support stats: free space, used space, lock count (from LockManager), active
  cursor count (examine all root nodes), active transaction count
  (Database.mUndoLogCount; doesn’t count use of UNSAFE)
